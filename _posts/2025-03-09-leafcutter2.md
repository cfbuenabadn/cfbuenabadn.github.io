LeafCutter2 enables identification and quantification of unproductive (NMD-associated) splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. Applying LeafCutter2, we uncovered a broad landscape of unproductive splicing across human tissues and in non-human animals. Analyzing data from the data from the AD Functional Genomics consortium FunGen-xQTL project, we also identify novel associations between unproductive splicing and Alzheimer's disease risk.
